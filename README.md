</details>


### ⚡ Distributed Ray Deployment
Scale your RAG pipeline across multiple machines and GPUs.
<details>

<summary>Distributed Ray Deployment</summary>

* **Horizontal scaling** - distribute processing across worker nodes
* **GPU acceleration** - optimize inference across available hardware
* **Resource management** - intelligent allocation of compute resources
* **Monitoring dashboard** - real-time cluster health and performance metrics

See the section on [distributed deployment in a ray cluster](#5-distributed-deployment-in-a-ray-cluster) for more details

</details>

### 🔍 Advanced Retrieval & Reranking
[OpenRag](https://open-rag.ai/) Leverages state-of-the-art retrieval techniques for superior accuracy.

<details>

<summary>Implemented advanced retrieval techniques</summary>

* **Hybrid search** - combines semantic similarity with BM25 keyword matching
* **Contextual retrieval** - Anthropic's technique for enhanced chunk relevance
* **Multilingual reranking** - using `Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-reranker-base`

For more details, [see this file](docs/features_in_details.md)

</details>


## 🚧 Coming Soon
* **📂 Expanded Format Support**: Future updates will introduce compatibility with additional formats such as `csv`, `odt`, `html`, and other widely used open-source document types.
* **🔄 Unified Markdown Conversion**: All files will continue to be converted to markdown using a consistent chunker. Format-specific chunkers (e.g., for CSV, HTML) are planned for enhanced processing.
* **🤖 Advanced Features**: Upcoming releases will include Tool Calling, Agentic RAG, and MCP to elevate your RAG workflows.
* **Enhanced Security**: Ensures data encryption both during transit and at rest.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12** or higher recommended
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- For GPU capable machines, ensure you have the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed. Refer to the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) for installation instructions.

### Installation and Configuration
#### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:linagora/openrag.git

cd openrag
git checkout main # or a given release
```
#### 2. Create a `.env` File
Create a `.env` file at the root of the project, mirroring the structure of `.env.example`, to configure your environment and supply blank environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
#### 3. File Parser configuration 
All supported file format parsers are pre-configured. For PDF processing, **[MarkerLoader](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker)** serves as the default parser, offering comprehensive support for OCR-scanned documents, complex layouts, tables, and embedded images. MarkerLoader operates efficiently on both GPU and CPU environments.

<details>
<summary>For more PDF options</summary>

For CPU-only deployments or lightweight testing scenarios, you can consider switching to **`PyMuPDF4LLMLoader`** or **`PyMuPDFLoader`**. To change the loader, set the **`PDFLoader`** variable like this `PDFLoader=PyMuPDF4LLMLoader`.

> ⚠️ **Important**: These alternative loaders have limitations - they cannot process non-searchable (image-based) PDFs and do not extract or handle embedded images.
</details>

#### 4.Deployment: Launch the app

>[!IMPORTANT]
> In case **`Indexer UI` (A Web interface for intuitive document ingestion, indexing, and management.)** is not configured already in your `.env`, follow this dedicated guide:
➡ [Deploy with Indexer UI](docs/setup_indexerui.md)

You can run the application with either GPU or CPU support, depending on your system:

```bash
# Start with GPU (recommended for better performance)
docker compose up --build -d  # Use 'down' to stop

# Start with CPU
docker compose --profile cpu up --build -d # Use '--profile cpu down' to stop it properly
```

>[!WARNING]
> The initial launch is longer due to the installation of required dependencies.

Once the app is up and running, visit `http://localhost:APP_PORT` or `http:X.X.X.X:APP_PORT` to access via:

1. **`/docs`** – FastAPI’s full API documentation. See this [detailed overview of our api](docs/api_documentation.md) for more details on the endpoints.


2. **`/chainlit`** – [Chainlit chat UI](https://docs.chainlit.io/get-started/overview) to chat with your partitions. To disable it (e.g., for backend-only use), set `WITH_CHAINLIT_UI=False`.

>[!NOTE]
> Chainlit UI has no authentication by default. To enable it, follow the [dedicated guide](./docs/setup_chainlit_ui_auth.md). The same goes for chat data persistancy, enable it with this [guide](docs/chainlit_data_persistency.md)

3. `http://localhost:INDEXERUI_PORT` to access the indexer ui for easy document ingestion, indexing, and management

#### 5. Distributed deployment in a Ray cluster

To scale **OpenRag** in a distributed environment using **Ray**, follow the dedicated guide:
➡ [Deploy OpenRag in a Ray cluster](docs/deploy_ray_cluster.md)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

### Error on dependencies installation

After running `uv sync`, if you have this error:

```
error: Distribution `ray==2.43.0 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're using CPython 3.13 (`cp313`), but `ray` (v2.43.0) only has wheels with the following Python ABI tag: `cp312`
```

This means your uv installation relies on cpython 3.13 while you are using python 3.12.

To solve it, please run:
```bash
uv venv --python=3.12
uv sync
```
### Error with models' weights downloading
While executing OpenRag, if you encounter a problem that prevents you from downloading the models' weights locally, then you just need to create the needed folder and authorize it to be written and executed

```bash
sudo mkdir /app/model_weights
sudo chmod 775 /app/model_weights
```
