[OpenRag](https://open-rag.ai/) is a lightweight, modular and extensible Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to explore and test advanced RAG techniques — 100% open source and focused on experimentation, not lock-in.

> Built by Linagora, OpenRag offers a sovereign-by-design alternative to mainstream RAG stacks.
