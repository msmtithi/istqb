A ranch is a farm for raising cows, horses, sheep or other livestock. Most ranches are large, but they can be any size. The word "ranch" is from the Spanish word "rancho". It is used in American and Canadian English. People who use a ranch are called ranchers.
A ranch may be on private or public land. The desert areas of the western United States have many ranches, because there is much land that is not very good for crops. There are also many in desert areas of Australia, where they are called stations. Someone who takes care of the livestock may be called a stockman or cowboy.
