In linguistics, noun phrases have grammatical number. Plural is one kind of grammatical number. In English, plural noun phrases are counted as more or less than one (e.g., "–32 degrees, no bananas", "0.5 liters", "1.2 grams", "two times", "three fish", "20 mothers"). In contrast, a singular noun phrase usually refers to something that you would count as one only (e.g., "one time", "a glass", "the sun", "my mother", "Jennifer"). Noun phrases that cannot be counted are also singular in English (e.g., "water", "the meat", "some space", etc.).
In many languages, a suffix (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word is plural. In English, the normal plural suffix "i"s "-s" (e.g., "cat" is singular, and "cats" is plural).
Plurals in English.
There are a number of exceptions:
It is fair to say that most native English-speakers make mistakes in this area, which is one of the more troublesome aspects of English.
Other languages.
All European languages have plural forms. The suffix that is used in each language is different from the one that is applied to English nouns.
In other languages, such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, there is usually no plural ending.
