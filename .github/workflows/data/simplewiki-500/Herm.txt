Herm is the smallest of the Channel Islands that is open to the public.
Herm is only 1​1⁄2 miles long. Cars are banned from the small island just like its Channel Island neighbour, Sark. Unlike Sark, bicycles are banned too. The sandy white beaches make Herm a walker's paradise.
Population: 60 (2002).
