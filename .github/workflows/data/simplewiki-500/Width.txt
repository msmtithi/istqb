Width or breadth is the side-to-side length, measuring across the object at right angles to the height.
For example, the distance between the left side and right side of a chair is its width.
Objects have a length and a width in two dimensions or more. In shapes such as rectangles, multiplying the length and the width equals the area of the shape.
