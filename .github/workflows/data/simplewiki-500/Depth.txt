In math, the distance between the nearest end and the farthest end of an object is its depth.
For example, you can measure the depth of a box. When you find the distance between one end of the box and another end of the box, you measure the box's depth.
Depth in Liquids.
For liquids, the distance between the top or surface of the liquid and the bottom of the liquid is the liquid's depth.
For example, water is a liquid. If you fill a container with water, the distance between the top of the water and the bottom of the container is the water's depth. If the depth is big, we say the water is deep.
