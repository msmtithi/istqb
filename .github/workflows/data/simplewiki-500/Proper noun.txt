A proper noun or proper name is a noun representing a unique thing (like "London", "Jupiter", "John Hunter", or "Toyota"), unlike a common noun, which represents a type of thing (like "city", "planet", "person" or "corporation"). Proper nouns are the only nouns in English which always have the first letter capitalized. 
In English, proper nouns don't usually come after an article or other limiting modifier (such as "any" or "some"). They are used for a particular person, place, or object. For example, a town called "Newtown" may be, but does not necessarily have to be, a new [recently built] town).
Which nouns are considered proper names depends on language. For example, names of days and months are considered proper names in English, but not in Spanish, French, Swedish, Slovenian or Finnish, where they are not capitalized.
